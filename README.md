### 📌 **Loops and Decision Statements in C**  

Welcome to the **Loops and Decisions Statement in C** repository! This repository contains C programs demonstrating different types of loops and decision-making statements, essential for control flow in C programming.  

---

## 📖 **About**  
This repository provides examples of:  
✅ **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`  
✅ **Decision Statements:** `if-else`, `switch-case`  
✅ **Nested Loops & Conditional Statements**  

## 🛠 **Topics Covered**  

### 🔁 **Loops in C**  
1️⃣ **For Loop** – Used for a known number of iterations.  
2️⃣ **While Loop** – Repeats until a condition becomes false.  
3️⃣ **Do-While Loop** – Executes at least once before checking the condition.  

### 🔄 **Nested Loops**  
✔ Using one loop inside another to handle patterns and complex iterations.  

### ⚡ **Decision-Making Statements**  
✔ **If-Else** – Executes a block of code based on conditions.  
✔ **Switch-Case** – Replaces multiple `if-else` for better readability.  
✔ **Ternary Operator** – A shorthand for simple conditional expressions.
